# CanYouFixMe Connector Challenge

Dare you fix this connector?

## Whuut?

Just a simple connector with a data table and two buttons.

Tables are very useful to store data from a myryad of data sources.

One can:
- Add a row to store new data;
- Update a row to reflect changes from received data;
- Or delete a row when its data is not needed any more.

## The bug

In this connector, adding or deleting a row is working as expected.

But when you press the update buttton, nothing happens!

Oh no! 

There it is: a _Table UNUPDATABLE_ (say it aloud... repeat... faster).

Not good. A table with stalled data...

## Your turn

Now that you are aware of the bug, go ahead and solve it. If you can...

## And...

Good luck!
